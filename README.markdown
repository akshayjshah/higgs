# The Higgs Twitter Dataset

Data from ["The Anatomy of a Scientific Rumor"][data] (De Domenico et al.),
mirrored here for convenience.

The [tarball][] contains four files, each of which contains a different portion
of the researchers' data. Each file is a list of edges in a directed graph; the
first node is the actor (e.g., the mentioner) and the second node is the
subject (e.g., the person being mentioned). Except for the social network
graph, all edges are weighted.
